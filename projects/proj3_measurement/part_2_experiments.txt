1. Experiment A
Q: Which ASes are Berkeley directly connected to?
Q: Which traceroute traverses the most number of ASes? How about the least number of ASes?
Q: Which websites' routes are load-balanced?
Q: Are the observed routes stable over multiple runs? For each website, how many unique routes did you observe?
Q: Using one sentence, please explain one advantage of having stable routes.
	The ASes of Berkeley are directly connected to


2. Experiment B
Q: How many hops do you observe in each route when you run traceroute from your computer? How many hops do you observe in the reverse direction?
	Number of hops from our computer to the public servers:
	18 hops to tpr-route-server.saix.net
	13 hops to route-server.ip-plus.net
	14 hops to route-views.oregon-ix.net
	13 hops to route-views.on.bb.telus.com

	Number of hops to our computer from the public servers:
	17 hops to tpr-route-server.saix.net
	23 hops to route-server.ip-plus.net
	9 hops to route-views.oregon-ix.net
	14 hops to route-views.on.bb.telus.com

Q: Are these routes symmetric? How many are symmetric and how many are not?
	None of these routes are symmetric.

Q: What might cause asymmetric routes? List one or two reasons.
	Traffic congestion is one potential cause of routing asymmetry.
